<h1 align="center">DGBclick Wallet</h1>

A **non-custodial, browser-based wallet** for [DigiByte](https://digibyte.org)'s **DigiDollar**
stablecoin. DGBclick Wallet lets a newcomer create a wallet, send and receive DGB, and mint, transfer,
and redeem DigiDollar — **without running their own node, and without anyone else ever holding
their keys.**

> Built on the open-source [diginaut-wallet](https://github.com/tonymorony/diginaut-wallet) by Anton Lysakov (MIT).
>
> This public repository receives **reviewed release snapshots** — development happens in a
> private repository, and each release here is a sanitized copy of exactly what runs at
> [wallet.dgbclick.com](https://wallet.dgbclick.com). Issues and PRs are welcome against this repo.

DigiDollar is DigiByte's decentralized, USD-pegged stablecoin: you mint it by locking DGB as
collateral for a chosen lock period, and redeem it to release that collateral. DGBclick Wallet builds and
signs every consensus transaction in your browser.

> **This fork** adds **Treasury Wallets**: split DGB into many independent, time-locked,
> individually giftable vaults, each minting $100+ of DigiDollar
> ([spec](docs/treasury-wallets-spec.md), [use cases](docs/treasury-use-cases.md)) — including
> **trustless gifting at creation** via Gift keys (the recipient owns the position from its
> first block; Core-wallet recipients are first-class,
> [proven on regtest](docs/discovery/core-recipient-gift-findings.md)), a resumable
> self-retrying batch engine, server-push block events, and encrypted GitHub backup/restore.
> It is also hardened for hostile browser and network conditions ([AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md)) and
> runs live on **mainnet** at **<https://wallet.dgbclick.com>**, backed by its own DigiByte
> Core **v9.26.5** node (DigiDollar active on mainnet since block 23,869,440). Upstream
> project: [tonymorony/diginaut-wallet](https://github.com/tonymorony/diginaut-wallet).

**Try it: <https://wallet.dgbclick.com>** (this fork, mainnet — real funds), or the upstream
author's instance at <https://diginaut.ludere.space> — create a wallet in seconds and explore the full
dashboard, mint calculator, and send/receive flows. A permanent **testnet instance at
<https://dgb.ludere.space>** lets you exercise the complete mint / transfer / redeem cycle with
valueless coins: create a wallet, claim testnet DGB from the built-in faucet, and mint DigiDollar
end-to-end. Both run the full stack in this repo against a DigiByte Core **v9.26.4** node with a
real oracle price feed. Want to host your own? See [docs/SELF-HOSTING.md](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md).

> DigiDollar minting is a DigiByte softfork. On testnet it is already active; on mainnet it
> activates network-wide at the softfork block. DGBclick Wallet enables the mint flow automatically once
> the node it talks to reports DigiDollar active — the same build serves every network.

## How it works

- **Keys live in your browser** (BIP39 seed, BIP86 taproot derivation), never on a server
  (ADR-0001). DGBclick Wallet is taproot-native.
- Consensus-critical transactions (mint / transfer / redeem) are **built and signed client-side**
  by the pure-protocol library, then broadcast through a shared read/broadcast node that never
  sees a private key.
- Before any fund-moving code ships, it must pass a **differential harness**: JS-built
  transactions byte-identical to DigiByte Core-built ones on regtest (ADR-0001, ADR-0002).
- **One build serves every network.** The banner, title, and address format are decided at
  runtime from the chain the node reports — nothing about the network is baked into the HTML.

## Monorepo layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `packages/digidollar-js` | Pure-protocol DigiDollar library — deterministic functions, zero I/O (ADR-0004). Mirrors DigiByte Core v9.26.4 arithmetic exactly. |
| `apps/wallet` | The DGBclick Wallet web app — dashboard, mint calculator, send/receive, and an RPC allow-list proxy. First consumer of the library. |
| `apps/indexer` | Address-level query façade (ADR-0003) over a stock ElectrumX — UTXOs and history by address only; xpubs never reach it. |
| `apps/faucet` | Testnet faucet — hands out valueless testnet DGB so new users have collateral to experiment with. |
| `docs/adr/` | Architecture decisions. `CONTEXT.md` is the domain glossary; `ROADMAP.md` traces how the project got here. |

## Run

```bash
npm install   # links workspaces (only audited @noble/@scure crypto deps)
npm start     # → http://localhost:8787
npm test      # node:test across all workspaces
```

**Mock mode (default):** without RPC credentials the app serves realistic fake data shaped like
real RPC responses — usable before you have a node.

**Real node:** copy `apps/wallet/.env.example` → `.env`, set `DGB_RPC_USER` / `DGB_RPC_PASS` /
`DGB_RPC_URL` (the `rpcport` from your `digibyte.conf`), load it and `npm start`.

## Consensus lock tiers (DigiByte Core v9.26.4)

Collateral required to mint, by lock period — from `src/consensus/digidollar.h`:

| Lock period | Collateral | | Lock period | Collateral |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 hour | 1000% | | 2 years | 275% |
| 30 days | 500% | | 3 years | 250% |
| 3 months | 400% | | 5 years | 225% |
| 6 months | 350% | | 7 years | 212% |
| 1 year | 300% | | 10 years | 200% |

Plus a 1% safety margin, and a Dynamic Collateral Adjustment (DCA) surcharge when system-wide
collateralization degrades. `digidollar-js` reproduces this arithmetic exactly (integer/BigInt,
ceiling division — see its tests).

## Safety posture

- The RPC proxy exposes an explicit **allow-list of read methods only**; fund-moving RPCs are not
  reachable from the browser.
- Mint is **never shipped without redeem and transfer** (ADR-0002) — no one-way traps.
- Keys are held only in the browser. **There is no server-side backup** — if you lose your device
  storage without having backed up your seed phrase, the funds are gone. Back up your seed.
- Known deferrals and their triggers live in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

## Status

All PRD stories are shipped and the wallet runs the full mint / transfer / redeem cycle. The
[roadmap](ROADMAP.md) records the path from the initial restructure (M0) through nodeless
onboarding (M1), the differential harness (M2), and the stablecoin release (M3). Work is tracked
in the repo's issue tracker; architecture decisions live in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/).

## Versioning

A deployed build identifies itself as `v<semver>+<short-sha> · <commit-date>` — in the
UI footer and machine-readably as `version` in `/api/config` (so each domain of a
dual-network deployment names the exact build it runs: `curl -s <domain>/api/config`).

- The **semver** comes from `apps/wallet/package.json` (the single source of truth) —
  bump it when behavior changes meaningfully.
- The **commit stamp** needs no manual step on the reference deploy path:
  `apps/wallet/.version-stamp` carries a git `export-subst` placeholder that
  `git archive` expands at deploy time (the prod deploy ships an archive, not a
  checkout). Running `node server.js` from a working tree asks git directly. A
  container built from a plain `git pull` checkout has neither, and honestly reports
  `v<semver>+dev` — deploy from `git archive` if you want stamped builds.
- Treat the string as opaque (it is not strict semver build metadata).
